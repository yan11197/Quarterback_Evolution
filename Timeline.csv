2002,Rule,Quarterback Helmet-Helmet Rule,"This rule states that it is illegal to hit a quarterback helmet-to-helmet any time after a change of possession. This eliminated a particularly ruthless bit of defensive strategy, where if the quarterback threw an interception or fumbled the ball, then defenders were taught to hit him in the head as hard as possible, in an attempt to injure them and knock them out of the game.

2006,Rule,Quarterback Low Hit Rule,"This rule states that low hits on the quarterback are prohibited when a rushing defender has an opportunity to avoid such contact. This was created to improve quarterback longevity, with the idea being that low hits often lead to injuries, which then result in short time spans for players. A quarterback with healthy legs lasts a long time in the NFL.",https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RFRUS2COZ4I6FIVY4RPDQDANOY.JPG,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dob-X-kIgOpGnNL8VVieaPZxGo8=/0x26:2633x1781/1400x1400/filters:focal(0x26:2633x1781):format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/47465302/usa-today-8869794.0.jpg
2007,Rule,Receiver Block Below Waist Rule,"This rule states that a block below the waist against an eligible receiver while the quarterback is in the pocket is a 15-yard penalty instead of a 5-yard penalty (an illegal cut block). Often times quarterbacks are the most vulnerable when their receivers are not open, because it means that they have to spend more time in the pocket. This rule gives receivers more opportunity to run successful routes so the quarterback can throw the ball quicker, and be safer.",http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/50741d4fecad048a5c000004-462-346/brian-cushing-injured-by-jets-cheap-shot.jpg,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlii_eSDyBUzCMrAQpnZlWPBV_A=/61x246:4311x3079/1400x1400/filters:focal(61x246:4311x3079):format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49146043/usa-today-8946331.0.jpg
2009,Rule,Defenseless Reciever Hit Rule,"This rule states that it is an illegal hit on a defenseless receiver if the initial force of the contact by the defender's helmet, forearm, or shoulder is to the head or neck area of the receiver. This rule makes it easier for quarterbacks to release the ball quickly because their receivers will be more willing to get into tough areas, as they feel more protected. Overall, this was a big push forward for player safety on the offensive end of the ball.",https://www.cbssports.com/images/blogs/harrison-smith21k-fine.jpg,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3t3aTjHi99cw9VE-0-i_c7xvyZE=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13704234/usa_today_12030884.jpg
2009,Rule,"The ""Tom Brady"" Rule","This rule clarified the rule regarding low hits on passers: A defender cannot initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit the passer in the knee area or below, even if he is being contacted by another player. This rule is called the Tom Brady rule, as he was injured for the rest of a season due to the results of a play where he was hit low. Ever since, quarterback's legs have been safer than ever.",https://operations.nfl.com/media/2675/dalton-low-hit.jpg?mode=max&width=995,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BbeIPgJkLLh9DtXBxT1r75iXoSs=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10147667/500122416.jpg.jpg

2007,Record,Tom Brady Breaks Single Season Passing Touchdown Record (50),"In an overall historic season, Tom Brady broke Peyton Manning's previous record and threw for 50 touchdowns in a single season.

2000,Rule,"The ""Bert Emanuel"" Rule","This rule states that when making a catch and falling to the ground, the ball is allowed to touch the ground and still be considered a catch if the player maintains clear control of the ball. This boosts quarterback's stats as it gives receivers more opportunity to catch the ball, so passing completions become much more common. Any time a rule like this is implemented to help the receiver, the quarterback also reaps the benefits.",https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/football-nfc-playoffs-tampa-bay-buccaneers-bert-emanuel-in-action-picture-id504769786,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/21/b219b31a-6ebb-5a5f-adbe-fc5c6b2c8d3a/5a3df48fbb716.image.jpg?crop=533%2C533%2C133%2C0&resize=1200%2C1200&order=crop%2Cresize
